AspGoatâ€™s purpose is to provide an intentionally vulnerable ASP.NET Core web application that helps developers and security professionals learn, practice, and teach application security. It bridges the gap between exploitation and remediation by offering hands-on labs aligned with the OWASP Top 10 and beyond.

### Road Map
* Q1: Launch initial release with core *OWASP Top 10* (and more) vulnerabilities, Docker setup, and documentation.
* Q2: Add advanced vulnerabilities (JWT, GraphQL, SSTI, OAuth, LLM Vulnerabilities).
* Q3: *STRIDE* Threat Modeling overlays for each vulnerability class to highlight architectural risks.
* Q4: Integrate *ModSecurity* WAF module in order to make the challenges harder (with a switch to hard mode button).
* Future Extension: Integrate a .NET Vulnerable *API* as a part of this project or by creating a separate project.
